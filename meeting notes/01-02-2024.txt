questions

1. Is it correct to just create a plane mesh in unity and then create particles and link each particle to a vertex of the mesh?
	- yea


- what matters a lot is that particles are shared. 
- ensure tesselated grid mesh has unique verticies
so that particles aren't stacked on top of each other

difficulty will arise
- when segments not have same length it will be a bit unstable
- solution is to increase quality of mesh so that there are more triangles
- make sure triangles are all same size 
- meshLab program has lots of mesh processing capabilties
- https://libigl.github.io/ - could be useful

- start and fix the points to the top

need to hook dlls cpp to c#
- start og in c# then try to go back and do cpp later

- possible to debug, good to handle exceptions cause it can crash unity.
